I have nearly 10 years of industry experience in the data science and analytics space, spanning a wide variety of sectors from hardware to education, specializing in natural language processing and user experience optimization, through experimentation and machine learning. I have experience working at both big tech companies such as Google, Shutterfly and Discovery Education as well as small startups in healthcare and education. 

My interest in data science actually started way back during my economics coursework and research at UC Berkeley. Since then I have continued my education by taking online courses and reading through ML textbooks (if you want to learn about some my favorite resources, feel free to click the [Education](https://pleonova.github.io/education/) section).


## Toolbox

I started my career in Stata and R and transitioned to Python. I frequently use both the python visualization libraries (`matplotlib` and `seaborn`) as well as statistical/machine learning packages (`scikit-learn` and `statsmodel`). I've written a handful of statistical functions and visualizations for evaluating online experiments in Python. For NLP, I utilize `transformers` and `pytorch` as well as other popular libraries such as `spaCy` and `NLTK`.

## Hobbies
When I am not working on my data side projects, I like to get outdoors whether that be up to the mountains in the winter for some snowboarding or the nearest park in the summer for some Ultimate Frisbee. I also enjoy [woodworking](https://www.instructables.com/My-First-Piece-of-Furniture-a-Bar-Cart/), [photography](http://girlandcamera.wixsite.com/novaphotography) and eurostyle tabletop and engine building board games (such as Terra Mystica and Brass: Birmingham).
