I have 5+ years of experience in the analytics space. As you can see below, I have worked in multiple industries and really enjoy the challenges that come with solving data problems. What my timeline below does not show however is all the additional online courses and books I've read to stay update to date with the best practices and latest technologies (see [Education](https://pleonova.github.io/education/)). I really enjoy learning and sharing that knowledge by giving talks and creating training materials for my colleagues. 

## My Background
 
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/my-background3.JPG" alt="">


I started my career in Stata and R and have transitioned to Python in the last couple of years.  I frequently use both the python visualization libraries (`matplotlib` and `seaborn`) as well as statistical/machine learning packages (`sklearn` and `statsmodel`). In addition to exploring data and creating models in Python and R, I am also familiar with various business intelligence tools such as Looker, Tableau and Chartio and have created dozens of dashboards.
