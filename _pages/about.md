I have 5+ years of industry experience in the analytics space. I have worked in multiple sectors and really enjoy the challenges and rewards that come from solving data problems. I also do my best to stay on top of the constantly evolving space by reading blog posts, taking online courses and occasionally reading through a textbook - the old fashioned way (if you want to learn about some my favorite resources, feel free to click the [Education](https://pleonova.github.io/education/) section). Furthermore, I enjoy destilling complicated concepts to others in the form training materials or talks so that I can help others on their learning journeys. 

## My Background
 
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/my-background4.JPG" alt="">

I started my career in Stata and R and transitioned to Python. I frequently use both the python visualization libraries (`matplotlib` and `seaborn`) as well as statistical/machine learning packages (`sklearn` and `statsmodel`). In addition to exploring data and creating models in Python and R, I am also familiar with various business intelligence tools such as Looker, Tableau and Chartio and have created dozens of dashboards.

## Other
When I am not working on my side projects, I like to go outside and play Pickup Ultimate Frisbee or play strategy board games indoors with friends (my current favorites are Caverna, Citadels, Terra Mystica). I also enjoy bringing out my Nikon SLR with me and taking portraits of friends (feel free to checkout out [my photography website](http://girlandcamera.wixsite.com/novaphotography)).
