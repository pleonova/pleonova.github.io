## Summary

Back in 2017, I was invited to give a talk at Product School at their San Francisco office about data analysis and visualization in Tableau in front of an **audience of 100+ professionals**. Since then I have given a variation of this talk at their other location in Santa Clara and at San Jose State University to a class of Business School students.

The original talk was taped and has been **watched 1.5K times** on Facebook, you can find the link [here](https://www.facebook.com/productschool/videos/1899646390253735/) or watch it below.

Furthermore, the dashboards that I designed and built for the talks have been **viewed nearly 2K times**. 

## Process
1. Data Collection
2. Dashboard Creation
3. Slide Deck with Instructional GIFs
4. Presentations

## 1. Data Collection
I initially set out to use previous work projects as examples but instead opted to collect my own data to make this project more personal. Since I embedded detailed GIFs into my deck, I did not want to use any proprietary data. I chose to track the places that I visited and length each visit for an entire month. 

I tracked how much time I spent: working, eating out, exercising, doing chores, cooking, etc. One of my personal goals was to perhaps learn something new myself and potentially change some of my hehavior based on what patterns I saw. I actually did end up changing 2 things after visualizing my data.

## 2. Dashboard Creation 
I created two interactive dashboards to explain the creation process as well as show a breadth of visualizations available in Tableau. The first one was a [general overview* of my month](https://public.tableau.com/profile/paula#!/vizhome/GuesstheUnderlyingDataexposed/SampleReport), which is typical of the types of high level dashboards companies have (I go into this in my talk). The second one was a [deep dive into my activities](https://public.tableau.com/profile/paula#!/vizhome/WhatdidIdoinMay2017/Activity1vsActivity2). Here I chose to focus in on any two activities.

## 3. Slide Deck with Instructional GIFs



## 4. Presentations

In the above recorded 20 minute talk, I presented some general tips for creating data reports as well as how to build indepth and dynamic dashboards in Tableau. The second part of the talk went into detail about how to build various types of visualizations, which includes 5-25 second instructional video clips that I go over. There was also a brief 15 minute Q&A section at the end.



If you want to refer to the slide deck*, you can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gv3b7p3a1bHBarQ5hTVK3Cf_Q9sbgXFxPpXZXR2S3NU/edit#slide=id.gc6f8954bc_0_53). 

\* *These slides do require special permissions, just shoot me a quick message and I'll be more than but I than happy to give you access. Please note that it might seem that there are lot of slides, but that is because I prefer to do slide transitions by creating a new slide and making very minor modifications rather than creating slide transitions.*
