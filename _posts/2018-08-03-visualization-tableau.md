Back in October of last year, I was invited to give a talk at Product School at their San Francisco office about data analysis and visualization in Tableau. Since then I have given a variation of this talk at their other location in Santa Clara and at San Jose State University to a class of Business School students.

The original talk was taped and has been watched 1.5K times on Facebook, you can find the link [here](https://www.facebook.com/productschool/videos/1899646390253735/). A better quality link on youtube also exists [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ1rGCAcQC0&t).

In this 20 minute talk, I presented some general tips for creating data reports as well as how to build indepth and dynamic dashboards in Tableau. The second part of the talk goes into detail about how to build various types of visualizations, which includes 5-25 second instructional video clips that I go over. There was also a brief 15 minute Q&A section at the end for those topics that I may have missed. 

If you want to refer to the slide deck*, you can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gv3b7p3a1bHBarQ5hTVK3Cf_Q9sbgXFxPpXZXR2S3NU/edit#slide=id.gc6f8954bc_0_53). 

\* *These slides do require special permissions, just shoot me a quick message and I'll be more than but I than happy to give you access. Please note that it might seem that there are lot of slides, but that is because I prefer to do slide transitions by creating a new slide and making very minor modifications rather than creating slide transitions.*
