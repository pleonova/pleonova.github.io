# Learning to play the Trombone

“Is he at it again!? Why must he practice the same song every time?” to which I confidently respond with, having only taken a couple of music lessons when I was ten, “It’s not a song, it is a chord!” and go about the rest of the morning without missing a beat (pun intended). 

However, while my partner has increasingly gotten frustrated with the same loud tune blaring from across the window, I have actually gotten used to it and applaud our neighbor in his consistency. 

Yesterday evening marked a special occasion, as our neighbor finally played a song on his Trombone. As I told my partner the news with glee, he seemed less amused as he looked at the clock which read 11:08 PM.

You might be asking yourself, how is this at all related to this blogpost, well I would say that it has everything to do with it. You don’t get better at something overnight, without putting in the time. Hopefully you don’t annoy your neighbors too much in the process.

# A statistics course is quieter 

Early on in the pandemic, I was feeling pretty ambitious and signed up for an online course. I was also curious about learning more about my study habits, so I recorded when, what and how long I studied. Was I just as persistent as our Trombone neighbor? Did I too study at odd hours of the day? What went on behind the scenes into finally earning my certificate and finishing my project (the equivalent of ‘playing my first song’)?

# The making of a Fitbit for learning

Since one of those doesn’t quite exist yet, I decided to combine data from two apps, RescueTime and aTimeLogger in order to semi-automatically track my study habits. While RescueTime passively works in the background, tracking which applications and websites I was using on my laptop and phone, I used the aTimeLogger app to ‘tag’ my time whenever I was learning. Even though RescueTime has a timer of its own, I prefer the easy to use interface of aTimeLogger, where you can easily re-use icons, add comments and nest activities with just a couple of taps. 

For this course, I made a ‘button’ for studying stats and all I had to do was press start/pause on my phone whenever I was studying. I realized that this simplicity really reduced the barrier for tracking and I had no problems recording my studying for the next 10 weeks.

# Pacing is key

I had 12 weeks to complete the course before my access to the course expired and so I planned to pace myself accordingly (nothing like a deadline to keep you motivated).

I actually ended up taking 10 weeks to complete the course + my own independent project. I completed the course in less time, not because I am an overachiever, but because I got a late start (would not recommend). I thought that I was pretty consistent in my studying, but turns out I only studied for only half the days. This was actually something I was quite surprised by, as I felt like I was studying A LOT.

If I would have properly paced myself, I would have needed to study just an hour a day, which is actually a very reasonable amount, instead I spent a handful of weekends with 6+ hours playing catch up. Unfortunately, I don’t think I would be able to study 100% of the days, as things always come up, so perhaps a goal of 70% of the days would be reasonable, bringing up my average up to 1.5 hours, which is still very realistic. 

About half my total time studying was on Saturdays and Sundays, or a total of 35 hours spanning across 8 weekends. I was actually somewhat surprised that I ended up taking off just 2 weekends during this duration, which, if I reflect more on, I entirely attribute to the shelter-in-place and the course deadline. It’s a little crazy to think that it took 8 weekends to reach the same amount of time as one work week. In the future, I don’t think spending 8 out of the 10 weekends studying will be super realistic.

This brings me back to my 70% days study goal. If I spent every weekday studying for 1.5 hours, I wouldn’t have needed to spend any weekends to complete the course! This is actually a very encouraging finding - this type of pacing is very attainable and provides some weekend buffers if I need to dip into the weekend.


# All you need is a textbook and 100+ other sources

This perhaps is the most interesting question and would be fascinating to curate if other students collected this information while taking this course or studying the same topic (if you are curious about this, see my [Sixty Second Pitch](https://pleonova.github.io/sixty-second-pitch/) post).

Aside from the X hours I spent on the course website, I spent nearly as much time on Miro.com completing my independent project. I built [this flow chart](https://github.com/pleonova/stat-tests) as both a way to solidify the concepts I learned as well as to hopefully serve as a resource for others who might find themselves deciding which statistical test applies to their data.


# Takeaways

I don’t need to give up my weekends in order to take an online course! If I just spend 1.5 hours during weekdays, I can get through the same amount of material. Having a 100% of days where I study will just lead to burnout when I want to make this a regular habit.

A pretty obvious tip, but worth saying anyway: Try to gain a good overview of the basics as soon as possible in order to get started with the assignment/personal project as that is where much of the learning happens. Though this is something I already knew, I feel like if I can more quickly go through the material just to get my bearings, then I can dive in sooner into a project and know where I can go in order to gain a better understanding of the concepts.
