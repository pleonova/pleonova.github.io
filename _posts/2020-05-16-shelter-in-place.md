I am no stranger to a Netflix season binge accompanied by some takeout and perhaps a bottle of wine. Youtube and I were also quite well acquainted before the shelter-in-place went into effect. I am familiar with the illusion of the short 5 minute video and how easily it turns into just 5 more minutes and before you know it, it's been 45 minutes. 

So how exactly has my life changed?

## Exercise, or the lack thereof

Too bad watching someone exercise on Youtube doesn't count. Walking from the couch to the kitchen back to the couch, then to my desk just doesn't add up to that many steps (it's less than 2k steps, but who's counting). 

I realized that I am a destination walker, I need purpose other than the walk itself. I used to walk to work when I got off the Caltrain in SF, not because I wanted exercise, but primarily because they moved the bus stop one street in the opposite direction of my office. I walked further to avoid paying extra parking costs. I'd walk to the field where pickup ultimate was, and if it was possible to park any closer to the field, I would have. 

Nowadays if I get more than 6K steps, that's a good day (though that was also a good day before, it was just less effort). Maybe I should consider adopting a dog, that is if there are any left in shelters. I have now walked around my neighborhood more in the last 2 months than I have in the 4 years that I lived here (who knew there was such a nice residential area several blocks over and even a couple of "hidden" parks).

So how does my activity level compare to before? If I just look at time spent moving, I spent an average of 3 hours doing some sort of physical activity before, whether it was walking over to the kitchen in the office or snowboarding on the weekend. I am currently spending a little less than 2 hours moving (you can only go on so many walks, imo).

What is interesting, though not really surprising if I think about it more, is how much variability I had before. I definitely had a handful of days where I got fewer steps in than I do now, but I would "make up for it" on the weekend (that's how exercise works, right). Ultimately, those "make up" days, at least time wise (not accounting for intensity), didn't really make up for the other days. Running a Welch's t-test on the data shows up that there was no real difference in time spent moving.

To add a bit more variety (and intensity to my occasional workouts), I have started cycling and, having watched enough Youtube videos, actually feel confident enough to give some of them a try ((Chris Heria)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaBqRxHEMomgFU-AkSfodCw], (Natacha Oceane)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjfG0dyMUiqKleUnkX6zBrA], (MadFit)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpQ34afVgk8cRQBjSJ1xuJQ] and (MrandMrsMuscle)[https://mrandmrsmuscle.com/pages/workouts]).

Hopefully some of the new habits stick around afterwards.  

So if I am spending less time moving, what am I spending more time on?

## My laptop and cellphone are my new best friends

Let's be real, they aren't new friends, we are just getting acquainted on a whole new level.
