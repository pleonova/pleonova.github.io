I am no stranger to a Netflix season binge or two accompanied by some takeout and perhaps a bottle of wine. Youtube and I were also quite well acquainted before the shelter-in-place went into effect. I am familiar with the illusion of the short 5 minute video and how easily it turns into just 5 more minutes and before you know it, it's been 45 minutes. 

So how exactly has my life changed?

First of exercise, or the lack thereof. Too bad watching someone exercise on Youtube doesn't count. Walking from the couch to the kitchen back to the couch, then to my desk just doesn't add up to that many steps (it's less than 2k steps, but who's counting). 

I realized that I am a destination walker, I need purpose other than the walk itself. I used to walk to work when I got off the Caltrain in SF, not because I wanted exercise (though that did become a reason later), but primarily because they moved the bus stop one street in the opposite direction of my office. I walked further to avoid paying extra parking costs. I'd walk to the field where pickup was, and if it was possible to park any closer to the field, I would. 

Nowadays if I get more than 6K steps, that's a good day (though that was also a good day before, it was just less effort). Maybe I should consider adopting a dog, that is if there are any left in shelters. I have now walked around my neighborhood more in the last 2 months than I have in the 4 years that I lived here (who knew there was such a nice residential area several blocks over and even a couple of "hidden" parks). 

Surely I am sleeping more...
